# VBA-challenge
For this challenge we had 4 Quarters of stock data with multiple openings, closings during the quarter for each type of stock. First, I needed to loop through all the types to condense the data with one row per stock type. Within this loop I needed to pull the first opening and the last closing values and find the difference for the quarterly change. I needed to set the first open at the start then before the loop restarted for thenext ticker I set the open value again after moving down one row in the summary table. Close value was pulled by selecting the final i value in that column within the loop. Percent change was the quarterly change/starting value. Total stock volume was also within the loop adding each value while the ticker was the same and resetting to 0 when thhe ticker changed. Greatest decrease and increase % and greatest volume were pulled using a conditional loop for the columns and min and max codes for finding them. Colors for quarterly change also used a conditional loop for that column with set colors. Any values not in the correct syntax were modified to the correct on at the end but before the next ws loop (to % for example) This was modified for all the sheets by looping throught the sheets and adding ws. to all the functions and cells. I also set all the headers for all the sheets using ws.cells().value rather than typing them into every sheet.
